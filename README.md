### What is PortableUTM?
PortableUTM is an ecosystem of products that has a clear objective: provide key actors with a reliable, highly-dependable, standards-compliant UTM solution for airspace management of [Unmanned Aerial Vehicles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle), also knowns as RPAs or simply drones. 

As airspace is usually shared between commercial flights and UAVs, our system allows to be used in an ATC environment for supervision of flights while allowing critical situation monitoring and automatic notifications.

Our system is also specially recommended for the usage in emergency disaster response teams and is easy to use for UAV operators to share their telemetry. 

### What is the PortableUTM WebApp?
The WebApp (also known as **Ades**) is the main hub for authorities and pilots alike. It supports both the monitoring of all airspace under the control of the authority and the management for pilots and UAV operators of their shared data with authorities and request of new authorizations.

### How to use?
Assuming a valid and correctly configured instance of the PortableUTM USSCore, *consts.js* has an **API** field that should be pointed to this correct instance.
Then, **npm install** and **npm start** should do the magic.

### How to contribute?
A contribution guide will be coming shortly.

### Main concepts
An **Operation** is the authorization request for a future flight to be performed by one or more pilots. By using the WebApp the pilot can define the various characteristics of the flight including Volume reservations, start and end time.

A system **Monitor** is an user that has the authority to view flight plans submitted, view a real-time map of aircraft in the air and receive important notifications generated by the system.
